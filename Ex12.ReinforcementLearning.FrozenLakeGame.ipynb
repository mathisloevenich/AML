        "\n",
        "#### OpenAI Gym\n",
        "In this exercise you will be using Python and OpenAI Gym to develop your reinforcement learning algorithm. The Gym library is a collection of environments that can be used freely with the reinforcement learning algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gym has a ton of environments ranging from simple text based games to Atari games like Breakout and Space Invaders. The library is intuitive to use and simple to install. Just run **pip install gym** and you are good to go! The link to Gym's installation instructions, requirements, and documentation is included in the description. \n",
        "\n",
        "Further reading about OpenAI Gym is available under https://www.gymlibrary.dev/.\n",
        "This notebook is based on this great post and notebook from [Rodolfo Mendes](https://morioh.com/p/18a96b9091d3).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Frozen Lake\n",
        "This description of the game is copied directly from Gym's website. \n",
        "\n",
        "*Winter is coming. You and your friends were tossing around a frisbee at the park when you made a wild throw that left the frisbee out in the middle of the lake. The water is mostly frozen, but there are a few holes where the ice has melted. If you step into one of those holes, you'll fall into the freezing water and die (Game over). At this time, there's an international frisbee shortage, so it's absolutely imperative that you navigate across the lake and retrieve the disc. However, the ice is slippery, so you won't always move in the direction you intend. The surface is described using a grid like the following:*\n",
        "\n",
        "* SFFF\n",
        "* FHFH\n",
        "* FFFH\n",
        "* HFFG\n",
        "\n",
        "This grid is your environment! S is your (the agent's) starting point and it's safe. F represents the frozen surface and is also safe. H represents a hole and if your agent steps in a hole in the middle of a frozen lake, the game is over because the agent dies. Finally, G represents the goal, which is the space on the grid where the frisbee is located.\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent can navigate *left, right, up, down* and the episode ends when the agent reaches the goal or falls in a hole. It receives a reward of **1** if it reaches the goal and **0** otherwise.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is the summary:\n",

        "Make sure you have worked down the task list and commented your doings. \n",

        "1. import the notebook to Google Colab or use your local machine.\n",
        "2. make sure you specified you name and your matriculation number in the header below my name and date. \n",
        "    * set the date too and remove mine.\n",
        "3. read the entire notebook carefully \n",
        "    * add comments whereever you feel it necessary for better understanding\n",
        "    * run the notebook for the first time. \n",
        "4. install gym into your env!\n",
        "5. You will train an agent to play the *Frozen Lake* game using Q-learning and you will get a playback of how the agent does after being trained.\n",
        "6. Again the task: Your agent has to navigate the grid by staying on the frozen surface without falling into any holes until it reaches the frisbee. If it reaches the frisbee, it wins with a reward of plus one. If it falls in a hole, it loses and receives no points for the entire episode.\n",
        "7. Your tasks are highlighted in the notebook (see below)\n",
